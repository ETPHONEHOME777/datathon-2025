# Retail: Accelerating the Sales of the Modecraft Ecommerce Store
The goal of this project was to analyze sales of Modecraft (an anonymized real-world ecommerce store/company) in order to provide metrics that could generate insights on operations, marketing, and well-performing areas. We specifically focused on analyzing the monthly trends in sales data to help the company make more informed decisions.

To address this, we developed a Monthly Analysis Report that allows users to select a month and year and view key performance metrics, including:

- Top-selling products and products with the least sales for that period

- Products that generated the most revenue and products with the least revenue impact

- Customers who made the highest number of purchases

- Most popular days of the week for purchases

- Most popular times of day during the week for customer activity

- Regions that generated the highest revenue

In addition to the monthly overview, we also created a Product-Specific Report, which displays:

- Quantity sold by country

- Quantity sold by month

- Quantity sold by time of day

- Quantity sold by day of the week

- Total quantity sold overall

- Total revenue generated by the product

Together, these tools provide Modecraft with a comprehensive, flexible way to monitor their business performance and identify opportunities for growth.

## Monthly Analysis Report Dashboard
1. Products that sold the most

In order to create this analysis, we filtered out negative values (returns) to look for successful purchases only. Filtering for the date and year, we grouped the dataset by StockCode and got the sum of all items by quantity. By doing this and then sorting from greatest to least, we found the item numbers that were purchased the most. While we did consider including a list of least purchased items, it was redundant, as many items held a quantity of '1' sold and would not display a very helpful statistic.

2. Products that generated the most revenue
